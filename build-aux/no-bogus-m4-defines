#   no-bogus-m4-defines - detect wrong m4 definitions
#   -------------------------------------------------
#   Try to catch the case where 'aclocal' pulls installed libtool
#   macro file contents from another version of libtool into the
#   current package 'aclocal.m4'.  Currently used by 'make dist'
#   and by ./bootstrap (bootstrap.conf).
